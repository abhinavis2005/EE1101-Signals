Given
x(t)=cos(2πt)+sin(3πt)+jcos(5πt)+jsin(7πt)

Plot the Fourier transform of the real, imaginary, even (conjugate symmetric) and odd (conjugate skew symmetric) part of x(t) and verify that they correspond to the even (conjugate symmetric), odd (conjugate skew symmetric), real and imaginary parts of X(w), respectively.
